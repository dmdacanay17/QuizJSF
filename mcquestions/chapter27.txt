#
Section 27.2 What Is Hashing?
#
1. A hashing function __________.
a. stores an element in the hash table
b. maps a key to an index in the hash table
KEY:b

#
2. If each key is mapped to a different index in the hash table, it is called _______.
a. normal hashing
b. perfect hashing 
KEY:b

#
3. A collision occurs _____________.
a. when two or more keys are mapped to the same hash value. 
b. when two elements have the same key value. 
c. when two elements are mapped to the same key.
KEY:a

4. Every object has the hashCode() method.
a. True
b. False
KEY:a

#
5. What is the return type value for the hashCode() method?
a. byte
b. short
c. int
d. long

#
6. Two objects are equal if their hashCodes are the same.
a. True
b. False
KEY:b

#
7. Two objects have the same hashCodes if they are equal.
a. True
b. False
KEY:a

#
8. If two strings are equal, the two strings have the same hashCodes.
a. True

a. linear probing
b. quadratic probing
c. double hashing.
